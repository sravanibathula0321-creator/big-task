The Travel Explorer Web Application is a simple front-end project built using only HTML. It demonstrates how multiple static pages can be linked together to form a mini website. The application contains a home page, a destinations page, a gallery, and a contact page. Users can navigate between these pages through hyperlinks. Although it doesnâ€™t use CSS or JavaScript, it shows the power of HTML in structuring data with headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and navigation links. This project is useful for beginners to understand how to create multi-page static web applications using just HTML.
